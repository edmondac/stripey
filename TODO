TODO file

- get the stripes
- javascript etc.
- refine the XML import process (which is a bit rough at the mo.)
- perhaps show corrections as red text with uncorrected portions shown in black - easier to see the correction in context and to compare with other mss...
- Default to showing identical readings/stripes with a group of mss:hand references, rather than listing them all (I.e. local text groups).
- add database indexes!
