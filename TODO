- get the stripes
- perhaps on the collation page, use streaming to speed up some display. Or indexes. Or something!!
- javascript etc.
- refine the XML import process (which is a bit rough at the mo.)
- perhaps show corrections as red text with uncorrected portions shown in black - easier to see the correction in context and to compare with other mss...
- Default to showing identical readings/stripes with a group of mss:hand references, rather than listing them all (I.e. local text groups).
- add database indexes!

From Hugh&Cat (16/7/13)
1. Try different algorithms in collatex (DONE)
2. Try fuzzy matching (DONE)
3. Get NA28 and/or TR as XML from Cat (DONE)
4. Can we get percentage agreements in this? (DONE)
5. Look at the most variant parts (highest ident letters)
6. Look at e.g. 5:7 in ms C - what do the correctors actually read here?
7. In idents, absent should be an empty box, or a special character
8. It would be nice if the chosen base text was all 'a'
9. Think about using the post-regularised data from ITSEE (talk to Cat)
10. Strip out diacritic marks (optional in UI?)
